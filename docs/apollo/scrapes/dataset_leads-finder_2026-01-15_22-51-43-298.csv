"Cincinnati","34068000","34.1M","Cincinnati","United States","Venture One was founded in 1996, born out of frustration with the shortcomings of industry standards for commercial construction. Our industry sometimes accepts marginal quality standards, inconsistent quality from project to project, and inability to replicate quality results across broad geographies. From its earliest days, Venture One began pioneering an approach to commercial construction that delivers superior results the first time, every time, anywhere. We have insisted on consistent quality through a process-based mindset that reproduces top quality standards project after project, regardless of the geographic area involved.

As a company, Venture One will always emphasize continual improvement, teamwork, integrity and productivity. We aspire to be a good corporate citizen, and we pursue philanthropic projects that offer a ""hand up"" rather than a ""hand out.""

Our clients have previously built or purchased semi-custom and custom homes, and they appreciate quality, professionalism, and our use of technology.
