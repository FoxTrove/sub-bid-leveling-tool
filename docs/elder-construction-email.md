**Subject:** Re: BidVet Bid Comparison Tool - Welcome!

---

Hey Ryan and team,

Thanks for being willing to give this a try—you're actually the first real estimating team to use BidVet, so your feedback will directly shape how this tool works.

**Getting Started**

Here's your exclusive sign-up link:
**https://bidvet.foxtrove.ai/join?invite=HANDSHAKE2026**

This gives you:
- 30 days of completely free access (we cover all AI costs)
- After that, you just add your own OpenAI API key (~$1-3 per comparison)
- BidVet itself stays free forever—no subscription to us

**If the Team Finds It Useful**

If multiple estimators end up using this regularly, we have a Team plan ($399/mo for up to 10 users) where we handle everything—no API keys to manage, just log in and use it. But start with the free access first and see if it's actually helpful.

**Two Asks**

1. **Feedback**: As you use it, take note of anything confusing, broken, or that could be better. Even small stuff like "this button should be over there" is helpful. Just reply to this email anytime.

2. **Training Data**: During signup, there's an option to allow anonymized data from your comparisons to help improve the AI. Your company info and actual bid details are never shared—it's just patterns that help train better models. Totally optional, but if you're comfortable with it, it helps us make the tool smarter.

Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

Kyle
